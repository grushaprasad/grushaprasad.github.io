I am a PhD student in the <a href= "http://cogsci.jhu.edu/" target = "_blank"> Cognitive Science department</a> at Johns Hopkins University working with Tal Linzen. I am interested in how people represent statistical regularities in linguistic structure and what factors can cause these representations to change. My approach to addressing these questions involves running psycholinguistic experiments on humans that are informed by computational models of the linguistic/ cognitive phenomenon of interest.

I am currently working on a project on syntactic adaptation looking at what people adapt to and what triggers adaptation. Previously (as an undergrad at <a href = "https://www.hampshire.edu/" target = "_blank"> Hampshire College </a>) I ran an ERP study looking at the cognitive effort (operationally defined as the P600 amplitude) involved in using singular 'they' for people who identify as having a non-binary gender and/or people who frequently interact with gender non-binary individuals. You can read more about both these projects under <a href= "/research/"> Research </a>.
