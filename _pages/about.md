I am a PhD student in the <a href= "http://cogsci.jhu.edu/" target = "_blank"> Cognitive Science department</a> at Johns Hopkins University working with Tal Linzen. I am interested in how people represent statistical regularities in linguistic structure and what factors can cause these representations to change. My approach to addressing these questions involves running psycholinguistic experiments on humans that are informed by computational models of the linguistic/ cognitive phenomenon of interest.

I am currently working on a project on syntactic adaptation looking at what people adapt to and what triggers adaptation. Previously (as an undergrad at <a href = "https://www.hampshire.edu/" target = "_blank"> Hampshire College </a>) I ran an ERP study looking at the cognitive effort (operationally defined as the P600 amplitude) involved in using singular 'they' for people who identify as having a non-binary gender and/or people who frequently interact with gender non-binary individuals. You can read more about both these projects under <a href= "/research/"> Research </a>.   

Outside of work, I get immense satisfaction from drawing parallels and making connections between seemingly obscure things - whether it is for some really convoluted pun (spend enough time with me and you will "adapt" to my sense of humour) or to draw analogies from connectionist theory when thinking about relationships. I also occasionally write haikus describing my state of mind - I find that the structural restrictions can sometimes help synthesize my thoughts (much like how a neural network might learn better when it has to compress the information from the input in a few units).
