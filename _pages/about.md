I am a PhD student in the <a href= "https://cogsci.jhu.edu/" target = "_blank"> Cognitive Science department</a> at Johns Hopkins University working with <a href= "https://tallinzen.net/" target = "_blank">Tal Linzen </a>. I am interested how humans and neural language models represent sentences -- specifically, what information about structure and statistical regularities is encoded in their sentence representations. I am also interested in how these representations change with experience. Working on these questions involves running psycholinguistic experiments on humans/ language models and thinking about how to compare the human representation space with that of the language models. 

Apart from this, I care about open science, replicability and issues of statistical power. I also care about fostering learning environments where students from diverse academic backgrounds can learn to use computational and quantitative tools to think precisely about cognitive phenomena. I would also almost always be up for discussions about philosophy of (cognitive) science, or any philosophical discussion really. 

Outside of work, I get immense satisfaction from drawing parallels and making connections between seemingly obscure things - whether it is for some really convoluted pun or to draw analogies from connectionist theory when thinking about relationships. I also occasionally write haikus describing my state of mind - I find that the structural restrictions can sometimes help synthesize my thoughts (much like how a neural network might learn better when it has to compress the information from the input in a few units).
