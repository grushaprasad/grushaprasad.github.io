<h2> Templates to generate semantically plausible sentences</h2>
<p>
Templates with over 200 verbs, 150 nouns, 20 adverbs and 70 adjectives that can generate semantically plausible sentences with five different types of relative clauses (active subject RCs, reduced and unreduced passive RCs and object RCs) and transitive sentences with verb coordination. The templates can be easily modified to also generate simple transitive sentences.

<h2> Resources for a hands-on workshop introducing experimental design and cognitive neuroscience to 8th graders </h2>

I ran a workshop on scientific thinking and experimental design for 8th graders in Oakridge International School in Bengaluru, India. The objectives of the workshop were to:

<ol>
    <li> Introduce core concepts of experimental design like hypothesis, independent variable, dependent variable, controls, confounds, theory, importance of sample size, statistical significance etc. </li>

    <li> A very basic introduction to neuroscience and the theory behind EEG/ ERP technology </li>

    <li> An introduction to thinking about cognition as mental processes that can be studied through observable behaviour </li>
 </ol>

 <p> 
    This workshop was designed such that we spent two long sessions with the theory and experimental design and then collected EEG data over a couple more sessions. However this can be tweaked for longer/ more spread out sessions and/or non EEG experiments.
