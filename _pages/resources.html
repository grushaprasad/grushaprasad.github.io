<h2> Resources for a hands-on workshop introducing experimental design and cognitive neuroscience for 8th graders </h2>

I ran a workshop on scientific thinking and experimental design for 8th graders in Oakridge International School in Bengaluru India. The objective of the workshop were to:

<ol>
    <li> Introduce core concepts of experimental design like hypothesis, independent variable, dependent variable, controls, confounds, theory, importance of sample size, statistical significance etc. </li>

    <li> A very basic inroduction to neuroscience and the theory behind EEG/ ERP technology </li>

    <li> An introduction to thinking about cognition as mental processes that can be studied through observable behaviour </li>
 </ol>

 <p> 
    This workshop was designed such that we spent two long sessions with the theory and experimental design and then collected EEG data over a couple more sessions. However this can be tweaked for longer/ more spread out sessions and/or non EEG experiments.
