<h2> Haikus </h2>

<p>
    <b> On moving on </b> <br>
    What if [something else] <br>
    Wistful counterfactuals <br>
    You will never know. 

</p>

<p>
    <b> Many homes </b> <br>
    There's love where I am <br>
    Tears toh kudina smiles <br>
    Leaving, arriving.

</p>

<p>
    <b> On not acting </b> <br>
    I like agency <br>
    When the ball's not in my court <br>
    Its hard to let go.

</p>

<p>
    <b> Syllable overflow </b> <br>
    With uncompressed thoughts <br>
    You'll run out of syllables <br>
    I guess I'll just stop n...

</p>

<p>
    <b> Task overflow </b> <br>
    A glance at the clock <br>
    Wave of things not done builds up <br>
    Breathe and pause through it.

</p>

<p>
    <b> Neutral jing </b> <br>
    You don't have to act <br>
    To observe can be enough <br>
    As it passes through.

</p>

<p>
    <b> Spring forward </b> <br>
    Breathing in spring air <br>
    Pretty skies, a gentle breeze <br>
    Calmness radiates.

</p>


<p>
    <b> Learning </b> <br>
    Weak prior knowledge <br>
    Can make concepts hard to grasp <br>
    Ughhh steep learning curve.

</p>

<p>
    <b> Literature Review </b> <br>
    So much work's been done <br>
    Stand on shoulders of giants <br>
    How to get up there?

</p>

<p>
    <b> On doing the brave thing </b> <br>
    Face fears heads on <br>
    You can do it! Keep going! <br>
    I am exhausted.

</p>

<p>
    <b> Choices </b> <br>
    The world's your oyster <br>
    To ease ball of anxiety <br>
    Embrace not knowing. 

</p>

<p>
    <b> Being on the job market </b> <br>
    I care about [things]!! <br>
    Sketching out a persona <br>
    Is it who I am? 

</p>

<p>
    <b> Interviewing </b> <br>
    Please describe yourself <br>
    Saying same things many times <br>
    Begin to feel fake.  

</p>

<p>
    <b> Growing up </b> <br>
    With the change time brings <br>
    This disillusioned adult <br>
    Misses earnest me.   

</p>

<p>
    <b> Signs from the universe </b> <br>
    Life is hard, complex <br>
    Can't plan/ understand all things <br>
    Be humble. Let go.
