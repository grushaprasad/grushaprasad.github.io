<h2> Haikus </h2>

<p>
    <b> On moving on </b> <br>
    What if [something else] <br>
    Wistful counterfactuals <br>
    You will never know 

</p>

<p>
    <b> Many homes </b> <br>
    There is love where I am <br>
    Tears toh kudina smiles <br>
    Leaving, arriving

</p>

<p>
    <b> On not acting </b> <br>
    I like agency <br>
    When the ball's not in my court <br>
    its hard to let go

</p>

<p>
    <b> Syllable overflow </b> <br>
    With uncompressed thoughts <br>
    You will run out of syllables <br>
    I guess I'll just stop n...

</p>

<p>
    <b> Task overflow </b> <br>
    A glance at the clock <br>
    Wave of things not done builds up <br>
    Breathe and pause through it

</p>

<p>
    <b> Neutral jing </b> <br>
    You don't have to act <br>
    To observe can be enough <br>
    As it passes through

</p>

<p>
    <b> Spring forward </b> <br>
    Breathing in spring air <br>
    Pretty skies, a gentle breeze <br>
    Calmness radiates

</p>


<p>
    <b> Learning </b> <br>
    Weak prior knowledge <br>
    Can make concepts hard to grasp <br>
    Ughhh steep learning curve

</p>
