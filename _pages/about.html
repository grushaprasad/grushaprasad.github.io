<p> I am a Computational Cognitive Scientist and an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at <a href= "https://www.colgate.edu/academics/departments-programs/department-computer-science" target = "_blank"}>Colgate University</a>. I was a PhD student in the department of Cognitive Science at Johns Hopkins University where I was primarily advised by <a href= "https://tallinzen.net/" target = "_blank"}>Tal Linzen</a>.</p>

<p>At a broad level I am interested in how humans and AI systems represent and process sentences. When studying human sentence processing, I use computational models to generate quantitative behavioural predictions from theories in (psycho)linguistics and then test these predictions using a variety of experimental paradigms. When studying sentence processing in AI systems, I draw on insights and methods from Linguistics and Psychology to generate and test hypotheses about the properties of sentences these systems encode and how they use these properties when performing some task. You can read more about this work on the <a href= "/publications/" target = "_blank"}>Publications</a> page.</p>

<p>Outside of my direct research interests, I enjoy playing around with analyzing and visualizing different kinds of data. I also care about open science, replicability and making computational tools accessible to students from diverse backgrounds.</p>
